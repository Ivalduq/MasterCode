We have studied two datasets containing the marks obtained by anonymous students of
sixth grade of primary school and fourth grade of ESO in the yearly Generalitat essential
knowledge and competences exams. These written evaluations measure the students
habilities in Mathematics, Science and Languages. We studied the correlations between
the median grade of each subject and the sex of the student. We found females consistently
outperform males in every language subject, whereas males perform better in Mathematics.
No significant difference was found in Science. This trend has already been observed
in previous literature with no concise explanation given to this phenomenon. For that
reason, new pathways of research are also suggested to shed more light on the dynamics
at play.
